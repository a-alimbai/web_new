        <p>As my friend says: “There are no trifles in life. After all, our whole life consists of little things. " And often these "little things" are not little things at all, but real miracles. And these miracles happen at every step. In our life, miracles happen every day, and sometimes every hour, but for some reason we do not perceive these miracles as MIRACLES. Either we are used to it, or we do not understand all their significance, we think that: “Fi, what a trifle, or it’s something great, something like the Wonders of the World. And what is this, this is just my life and everything that happens every day is such little things ".</p>
